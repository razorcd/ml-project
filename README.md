# ML project

Once you move to Berlin, the hardest thing you face is renting an apartment. The competition is very high and prices vary a lot.
I have built this ML application to predict the baseRent of an apartment based on features like living space, rooms, area, etc.
This way you can check what you can afford or if you already found an apartment you can check what would be the correct price to pay.

The dataset is based on data from 2018 - 2019. I suggest to add 10% more to the final prediction to reflect 2021 rental prices.

## Data Set

https://www.kaggle.com/corrieaar/apartment-rental-offers-in-germany

Dataset contains information from entire germany. 
I have selected only data from Berlin. This gives around 10000 records.

## Development System
  - OS: x64 Linux Ubuntu

# Project progress

Jupiter notebook has progress comments on each step.

1. PrepareData: 
    - source: [data_analysis.ipynb](data_analysis.ipynb)
    - selected only Berlin data
    - checked and removed invalid data
    - select features
    - split data 60/20/20
    
2. Trained a Linear Regression model:
    - source: [capstoneProject_linearRegression.ipynb](capstoneProject_linearRegresion.ipynb)
    - notice this notebook is linked to the data_analysis notebook
    - tried different columns and countries to find most accurate combination.
    - Columns selected for training: 
        - `x = [cellar	baseRent	livingSpace	noRooms	heating	neighborhoods]`,
        - `y = 'baseRent'` (numerical)
    - found `MAE = 257.0` and `Model max deviation for 50: 15.041 percent`
3. Trained a xgboost model:
    - source: [capstoneProject__xgboost.ipynb](capstoneProject__xgboost.ipynb)
    - source2: [target_encoding/capstoneProject__xgboost_target_encoding.ipynb](target_encoding/capstoneProject__xgboost_target_encoding.ipynb)
    - notice this notebook is linked to the data_analysis notebook
    - tried different xgboost properties: max_depth, eta
    - found best xgboost arguments with smallest depth:  `max_depth: 20, eta: 0.6`
    - Columns selected for training: 
        - `x = [newlyConst	balcony	hasKitchen	cellar	livingSpace	lift	noRooms	garden	heating	neighborhoods]`,
        - `y = 'baseRent'` (numerical)
    - found `MAE = 219` and `Model max deviation for 50: 27.391 percent`
4. Trained a neural network Keras model:
    - source: [capstoneProject_keras.ipynb](capstoneProject_keras.ipynb)
    - notice this notebook is linked to the data_analysis notebook
    - converted categorical values to numerical values using LoadEncoding
    - converted booleans to ints
    - used different Dense layers with various units
    - tried different Keras parameters: learning_rate, batch_size, epochs, optimizer
    - found best Keras parameters:  `learning_rate: 0.01, batch_size: 50, epochs: 40`
    - Columns selected for training: 
        - `x = [newlyConst	balcony	hasKitchen	cellar	livingSpace	lift	noRooms	garden	heating	neighborhood]`,
        - `y = 'baseRent'` (numerical)
    - found `MAE = 265`
5. Built model_training script using xgboost because it was most accurate.
    - source: [server/train_model.py](server/train_model.py)
6. Created web server to serve model using an API
    - server app source: [server/](server/)
    - server python file source: [server/serve.py](server/serve.py)
    - note the web server can do batch predictions to improve performance. Request payload accepts an array of data and will return an array of predictions in same order.
    - web server will catch some exceptions to return user friendly error messages and correct Status Code.
    - server can be started using vanilla Python or Unicorn.
    - see below how to start it and how to call it
7. Created Docker image with the web server
    - source: [server/Dockerfile](server/Dockerfile)
    - docker image is serving the API on port 9000
    - see below how to build and run the docker image
8. Deployed to DigitalOcean using the docker image.
    - see below how to call ML-project1 running in cloud
    - this was deployed manually due to lack of time to do proper CI

# Steps to run the application.

##
Unzip `immo_data.csv.zip`, file is too big for Github.

## Build final model

## TODO checklist:

 - [x] find Dataset
 - [x] cleanup data
 - [x] perform EDA (exploratory data analysis)
 - [x] prepare data for model training
 - [x] train with linear logistic regression
 - [x] train with xgboost
 - [x] train with Keras/Tensorflow (optional)
 - [x] create server and dockerize
 - [x] deploy to cloud (optional)
